# ReactJS Demos

This is a folder full of example projects using react and django. These are open source projects that are typically modified from pre-existing examples on the web.

- [drf-react](https://github.com/geezhawk/drf-react): a very simple example. Start here.
- [plain-react](https://testdriven.io): test driven development course adapted for plain django (none-rest)
- prest-react: experimental react/prest stack with explicit JWT authentication as a proof of concept.
- postgrest-react: experimental react/postgrest stack with role based authentication through JWT

# IMPORTANT: These don't Work

The following don't work and are just here for demo purpose:

- docker-react-redux-boilerplate
- redux-in-docker
