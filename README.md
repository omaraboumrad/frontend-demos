# ReactJS Demos

This is a folder full of example projects using frontend frameworks and a mix of backend solutions. These are open source projects that are typically modified from pre-existing examples on the web.

- [drf-react](https://github.com/geezhawk/drf-react): a very simple example. Start here.
- [plain-react](https://testdriven.io): test driven development course adapted for plain django (none-rest)
- [prest-react](/prest-react): experimental react/prest stack with explicit JWT authentication as a proof of concept.
- [postgrest-react](/postgrest-react): experimental react/postgrest stack with role based authentication through JWT
- [postgrest-rls](/postgrest-rls): experimental postgrest stack with hierarchical role based authentication through JWT and postgres row level security (database heavy configurations)
- [postgrest-elm](/postgrest-elm): experimental mix of postgrest and elm
